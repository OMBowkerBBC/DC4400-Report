\section{Work Done}
  In this next section I will discuss the work that was carried on the project. In our team we have \textit{'ways of working'}
  flowchart that helps guides us in how the project should be done throughout the team (GoRetro, 2023). Our ways of working is broken down into 5 sections, 
  all of which will be discussed.

  \footnote{\textbf{B1} - This section shows how a systematic approach to software development was used for the project.}
  \footnote{\textbf{SE-S01} - This section will discuss the build, architecture and changes to initial design, task creation and release strategies.}
  \footnote{\textbf{SE-S06} - Through this section it will be demonstrated how we assure quality by sticking to our ways of working. This includes testing, 
  code reviews, releasing and monitoring software.}
  \footnote{\textbf{SE-K03} - This section and the diagram in the appendix shows our ways of working which was followed during the project.}
  \footnote{\textbf{SE-K05} - This section also steps through how the system was designed, developed and deployed to AWS.}
