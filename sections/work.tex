\section{Work Done}
  In this next section I will discuss the work that was carried on the project. In our team we have \textit{'ways of working'}
  flowchart that helps guides us in how the project should be done throughout the team (GoRetro, 2023). Our ways of working is broken down into 5 sections, 
  all of which will be discussed. For a full diagram of our workflow see \hyperref[sec:AppendixD]{\textbf{Appendix D}}.
  \footnote{SE-K03 - This section and the diagram in the appendix shows our ways of working which and how it was followed during the project.}
